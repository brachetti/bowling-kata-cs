# Bowling Kata (C# version)

This is my first adventure into the .NET platform (like, ever).
I decided to write a small application that can generate the score for a bowling game.
Also, I am following a test-driven approach, to understand how the ecosystem and SDLC ties together on this platform.

## Feedback

I appreciate any kind of feedback on the approach I am taking, the solutions I found, on readability and anything else really.

## License

I couldn't care less ;-)
